## Definition of a LendingClub:

A ***Lending Club*** is a platform that allows individuals to lend to other individuals.This could be for various purposes such as debt consolidation, home improvement, education, or small business funding.

They provide an alternative to traditional banking channels by leveraging technology to streamline the lending process and offer potentially better rates for both borrowers and investors.

To make this date more cleare and studiable , I cleaned it by :
